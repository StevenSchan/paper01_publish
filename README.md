** Code availability and review policy **

We are committed to full reproducibility and academic integrity. To respect standard editorial policies on priority and to align with the submission process for the journal, the complete, fully reproducible code and processed datasets will be released to this public repository immediately upon final publication.

During the peer-review stage we provide a lightweight, documented model skeleton in this repository so reviewers can inspect the algorithmic design and key implementation details. If a reviewer or handling editor requires additional code or the full data needed to reproduce our results during review, we will gladly provide them on request. Please direct such requests either (a) via the journal’s handling editor or (b) by sending an anonymized request to the corresponding author; we will respond promptly and supply reviewer-only materials under the journal’s confidentiality procedures.

This approach balances transparency and reproducibility with standard protections for unpublished work. We welcome reviewer questions and will cooperate fully to facilitate verification of our results.

We had no choice but to take the above approach because during the previous submission process, we encountered some reviewers who did not abide by academic ethics and tried to plagiarize and copy our entire research work by threatening to reject the manuscript.
